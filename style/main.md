# 🌳About Our Project- Carbon Manager -A Unique Solution to Global Warming using AI

Presenting to you, world's first ever, most accurate (98%), most user-friendly, AI-powered platform, which even a 5+ child can use, designed to empower individuals to calculate, understand and reduce their own carbon footprints through answering just a few of their daily life questions, contribute to reforestation efforts to offset their carbon emission, and collectively combat climate change. Through a combination of accurate carbon footprint prediction, and the data inputted, innovative AI personalized action suggestions are provided to reduce their carbon foorprint, and tree-planting facilitation (both by self and through NGOs to offset their emission), our project aims to empower users to become active participants in creating a sustainable, clean green future and stand against the evil of humanity- The Global Warming...

#### BIG UPDATES!:
1. Based on the monthly inputs sent, you will be provided Carbon Reward Points which you can redeem to purchase any eco-friendly or carbon-friendly items from anywhere on Earth you wish to. Also adding to the glory, a leaderboard will be set up soon based on the top Carbon Warriors of the previous month, which would not only provide people fame, but also tends to inspire millions.
2. The data used to feed our AI model has been synthetically generated, calculated based on weightings from various studies and sites that currently compute the dependent variable, carbon emissions, attempting to maintain values close to reality. Thus to ensure an even more accurate result, we introduce yet another amazing feature named "Correction Factor". We invite all the experts from reputed industries and authorities to try our app and compare the calculated footprint on our app with that of their sensors or mathematics and science, and present to us if there is any difference or issue between the findings, by clicking on the "Report Correction Factor" button. Submit a detailed report with adequate proof and information. We shall soon review it and if there is (really) any noticable difference between the true findings and our findings, we shall try to improve the accurate results of our project even more by using a Correction Factor and make this platform even more powerful.
3. A plugin of our specially designed LLM (AI Chatbot) has been integrated at the bottom right corner of this page. Please note that you wake it up by an appropriate message before use. Apart from the plugin you can use it anytime on its pro-UI with special features like chat history, no-wake-up mode, light-dark theme, etc. at: https://chatbot-apon.onrender.com . (Please note that, the Chat UI has been hosted on Render, and can take around 40 seconds to load. Please wait for the page to load before interracting with the ChatUI.)
4. A community forum named ["Carbon Manager-Forum"](https://bit.ly/CarbonManagerForum) has been introduced to create a social-networking site for asking, chatting, learning, suggesting, marketting, news and updates, research, and many more for a sustainable Carbon-friendly, clean green Earth. All the more, based on the Carbon Footprint Report and Offset Proof, and other activities on the forum, special and exciting badges beside their names will be awarded to the respective users, giving them fame.

[(?)A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions linked to an individual, organization, event, or product. It's a crucial metric for gauging our impact on the environment and climate change.]
